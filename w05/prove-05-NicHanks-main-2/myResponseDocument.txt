Write down an answer to the question in your response document as if you were giving a verbal response

purpose/behavior/performance of the task at hand is:
A function to find the intersection of two sets is finding the common element of the list 
by identifying two common hashes. Since this can quickly be done its performance is O(1),
and the behavior for finding intersection is basically just looping through the list untill 
a hash matches another. 

A function with the union properties will basically find all of the common variables of two lists, 
or HashSets. For example, with an O(1) performance it will look for hashes that are duplicates.
